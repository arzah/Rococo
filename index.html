    <h4><strong>What is Rococo?</strong></h4>
<!-- paragraph tag for bulk of information -->
    <p>Rococo is an art movement that took place in the late 17th century and is
   known for being very extravagant and ornamental. The primary colours used during the 
  movement were pastel which gave the artwork generated during that period a very lighthearted
appeal to it. I have replicated this in the design of my website by utlilising pastel pink as the 
background colour, a pastel blue for the navigation bar as well as the added touches of an elegant
white font style and a gold border to surround the home page title. </p>

   <h4><strong>The Birth of Rococo</strong></h4>
    <p> The Rococo movement began in France 1699 after the then French king,
      Louis XIV  demanded for more youthful work to be created under his reign.
      During this time Jeane Antoine Watteau could be considered the “father”
      of the Rococo movement, giving birth to a new technique called

  <h4>Legacy</h4>
  <p>Although the movement has passed Rococo is considered to be one of the most influential French art movement in 
    history. It's fancilful paintings, use of pastel coloura and elaborate attention to detail has firmly cemented this 
    art movement in both history and the minds of artists everywhere. </p>
